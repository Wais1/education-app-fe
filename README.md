**Project Solution**
- EduApp is a web application that aims to use existing high quality video learning resources available in YouTube and organize them in such a way that it creates a structured course for users to follow. With EduApp, students get to access high quality educational videos that come from YouTube. The videos are grouped by topic and are organized in such a way that users can grow their knowledge on their specific topics. Furthermore, each learning resource may be shuffled such that learners have different material for a topic until they are satisfied. And the best thing about the app is that it’s free. Since we’re using available videos on YouTube, we can sustain this application without paying for education content creation and users don’t have to pay for our services. For our minimum viable product, we provide users with the capability of improving upon our services by uploading learning resources to our app. Therefore, in the future, we plan to create an algorithm to organize the learning resources based on user ratings to ensure that the content which users view will be helpful to them. With our app, our goal is to provide structured learning material to students for free.
